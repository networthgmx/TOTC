<section class="main-content">
<p>Welcome, to a tale of two cities. The red half of Liverpool and the
blue half of Manchester.</p>
<p>This information was originally compiled after the 2018-2019 Premier
League season. With Manchester City having risen to dominance after
acquisition by new ownership (Abu Dhabi United Group), it was
interesting to watch Liverpool push them and finish a single point
behind. Now, we know that Liverpool went on to win the Premier League in
the subsequent 2019-2020 season.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to us was the impact of new ownerhip more
than, say, tactical differences. While tactical and coaching approaches
may have equally significant impacts to financing, it was the influence
of the new ownership group that we were interested in comparing.</p>
<p>We also wanted to learn some R language and the interactive graphics
available through the Plotly package. This information is presented in a
series of Rmarkdown documents rendered in html.</p>
<p>The original work was deployed through blogdown to github and
published via Netlify. This is no longer maintained and is now published
on Github Pages. We may or may not update some of the work here.</p>
<p>Feel free to browse through the navigation menu and enjoy.</p>
