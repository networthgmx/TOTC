Welcome, to a tale of two cities. The red half of Liverpool and the blue half of Manchester.

This information was originally compiled after the 2018-2019 Premier League season. With Manchester City having risen to dominance after acquisition by new ownership (Abu Dhabi United Group), it was interesting to watch Liverpool push them and finish a single point behind. Now, we know that Liverpool went on to win the Premier League in the subsequent 2019-2020 season.

Of particular interest to us was the impact of new ownerhip more than, say, tactical differences. While tactical and coaching approaches may have equally significant impacts to financing, it was the influence of the new ownership group that we were interested in comparing.

We also wanted to learn some R language and the interactive graphics available through the Plotly package. This information is presented in a series of Rmarkdown documents rendered in html.

The original work was deployed through blogdown to github and published via Netlify. This is no longer maintained and is now published on Github Pages.
